## My process

I started by diving the page into smaller sections and tackling each one at a time. Starting at the top to bottom while adding some functionality using vanilla JavaScript when an interaction is required. I also used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for laying out things.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a great experience since it allows me to get used to understand the CSS Grid and Flexbox more deeply. I also managed to optimized my JS code.

### Continued development

I will be focusing more on responsive design.
